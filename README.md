<!-- Grooming -->
## Grooming
Grooming is a crucial step in the project life cycle, focusing on refining requirements and addressing potential issues in the early planning stages. Identifying and resolving issues at this phase is significantly more efficient than dealing with them after the code has been written, allowing developers to create a solid design for their software.


### In the Grooming Stage:
During the grooming stage, the team, consisting of engineers, designers and product stakeholders, engages in detailed discussions to refine the requirements of the product. This includes exploring use cases, understanding use case realizations, and further scoping the project.


Questions to ask at this stage:
- Does the design align with the product vision and goals? üéØ
- Is the proposed requirements technically feasible? üíª
- Can requirements be broken down following the MoSCoW rule? üì¶
- How can MoSCoW rule define the Minimum Viable Product? üöÄ
- What scale and performance levels are expected? ‚öñÔ∏è
- Who is the target audience, and how does the frontend cater to their preferences and needs?
- What are the dependencies and constraints to address? ü§ù
- What are the accessibility and usability requirements for the frontend?
- Are there any technical constraints or limitations that could impact the design?
- Are there specific design considerations or patterns that should be applied to meet the product's objectives?
- Will the application be used on mobile devices?
- Is it B2B/B2C/Internal/Consumer Facing etc.


What to Do in This Stage:

- Collaboratively gather requirements.
- Thoroughly scope the project.
- Prioritize backlog items.
- Detail requirements for clarity.
- Clarify Ambiguities, Address and resolve uncertainties.

Outcome: 

The outcome of the grooming stage is a fine set of requirements, both short term and long term for a component. These can further be split at a high-level as:

- Functional requirements
- Non Functional requirements
- Failover requirements
- Operational requirements
- Functional dependencies

## Solutioning
Solutioning is a pivotal phase in the project life cycle, where the focus shifts from refined requirements to crafting a comprehensive plan for implementation. It involves assembling various components, identifying their responsibilities, and providing a high-level estimate of the work required. During solutioning, special attention is given to non-functional requirements and failover strategies, laying the groundwork for a robust and sustainable technical solution.

- Clearly define the target outcome in measurable terms, allowing for effective comparison and evaluation.
- Articulate specific requirements that must be met by any optimal technical solution.
- Ensure that the solution is sustainable and adaptable to future changes and advancements.

Questions to ask at this stage:

- What is the cost of the solution?
- Are users on Mobile/Desktop/Tablet? 
- Is SEO needed ? 
- Offline support needed?
- Can you deploy each use case independently?
- Do I have clarity on my dependencies? 
- Is it B2B or B2C 
- Is it Consumer Facing or Internal ? 
- Internationalization / Localization support needed ? 

Outcome:
- High-Level solution including system level dependencies and constraints/limitations
- Component Dependencies
- Component Responsibilities
- Rough effort estimates


## Design
The design phase is critical for translating high-level requirements into detailed and actionable plans. This section encompasses both the High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD), providing a comprehensive guide for the development team to implement the solution effectively. Additionally, it outlines key design principles and guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability across the project.

### HLD
The High-Level Design (HLD) phase is a crucial step undertaken by engineering teams to establish a blueprint for component implementation. This process precedes the actual development, ensuring a clear and comprehensive plan before diving into project implementation. 

While the specific considerations may vary based on project nature,The below aspects need to be considered during the HLD phase

## Technology Choice

The selection of technologies for your frontend system is a critical decision that significantly influences the project's success. It's essential to recognize that each technology comes with its own set of trade-offs, and the suitability of a particular tool or framework depends on the specific context and requirements of your project. 

Here's how to approach the technology choice:

Important points to consider while choosing a Technology or Framework 

**Requirements and Feature**
- Size of project: large / medium / proof of concept 
- Performance Requirements ie Page Load speed etc.
- Look for specific Project requirements such as support for Server side rendering, Mobile support, SPA, User Experience etc

**Coding time and efficiency**
- Speed of development , testing and deployment.
- Ease of use 
- Learning curve 

**Community support and Adoption**
- Strong community support on tools, issues and resolutions
- Battle tested in production (if not a proof of concept)
- Take references of tech usage from big companies to understand if it is being battle-tested. It can be used in production without any worries

**Leverage from what is already available**
- It‚Äôs easier to build new applications with the tech we already know so that we do not go through the steep learning curve.

**Flexibility to Scale**
- Assess the level of customization and extensibility provided by the framework. Choose a framework that allows you to tailor the components and styling according to your project's unique requirements.
-  Evaluate how well the framework integrates with other tools, libraries, and development ecosystems, such as build tools, testing frameworks, and state management solutions.

**Documentation and Resources**
- Check the availability of tutorials, guides, and community forums.

**Others**
- Security Considerations: Ensure that the framework or library follows best practices for security.
- License Compatibility: Review the licensing terms of the framework or library to ensure it aligns with your project's licensing requirements and policies.
- Ensure that the framework or library is compatible with the target browsers and devices.
